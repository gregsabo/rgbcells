This project is simply an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in coffeescript for the HTML canvas element. My goal was to make the code as easy-to-understand as possible. I tried to do this with semantically organized classes, as follows:

A Field is a 2d-array of Cells.
A Cell is a CellArea, some Effects, and a Billboard.
A CellArea is a set of references to 8 nearby Cells.
An Effect is protected state which generates a Color for each frame depending on the state of the other Effects in the surrounding CellArea.
A Billboard is a rectangle that is repeatedly drawn on an HTML canvas in a certain Color.
A Color is some amount of alpha, red, green, and blue.

The program intiailizes a Field of Cells then repeatedly calculates the changes in Effects to each of those Cells, displaying the resulting Colors on Billboards using an HTML canvas.
